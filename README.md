AutoMount for XenSystem

To provide  more features, I rewrite AutoMount originally written 
in bash script using python 2. This script is mainly provided for some 
customers who still use the vps powered by Xen, only considering their 
needs and what they may encounter.

## How to use

```
wget -o AutoMount.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gidcs/automount/master/AutoMount.py
chmod 755 AutoMount.py
./AutoMount.py
```
